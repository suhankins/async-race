# Async-race

Created when I just joined Itransition. It was during the time when product was bought by another company and this caused massive delays when it came to giving me access to the project, so while I was waiting I was giving this task to practice Redux and Redux Saga.

Implementation of [Async-race](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/async-race.md) with a couple of minor changes:

1. Uses React
2. Uses Redux and Redux Saga
3. Uses SASS and Bootstrap
4. Uses Vite
